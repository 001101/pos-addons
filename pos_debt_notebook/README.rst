Debt notebook (technical core)
==============================

The module adds



Menus are visible only for users who are in groups specified in the fields: "groups_id" and "extra_groups_id".

It can be used to temporarily restrict access to menu for all users.
E.g. in Project application only Project Users and Project Managers have access to Project menu. 
Without this module you have to remove these access groups from all users, which means that user hierarchy is lost. 
The module solve this issue.
